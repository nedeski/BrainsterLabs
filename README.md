# Brainster Labs | Front End Academy

====================================

## Purpose of the project

Brainster Labs is a project on which we will place all the projects Brainster students (Design Academy, Coding Academy, Marketing Academy) have made.

This page consists of several parts.

1. Top menu (navbar) which will contain the following links.

- Logo that will lead to the index page itself,
- Marketing Academy which will lead to the following link:
  https://marketpreneurs.brainster.co
- Programming Academy which will lead to the following link:
  https://codepreneurs.brainster.co
- Design Academy which will lead to the following link:
  https://design.brainster.co
- Button that will take you to a new page with form.

2. Banner with image and text
3. Filters
4. Cards with projects from the academy. (20 cards in total) 6 marketing, 10 coding and 4 design
5. Footer

- Below header, there should be 3 filters for filtering project cards from different academies.

- On mobile devices only 6 cards will be shown at first. There should be load more button as well. Everytime we click tothis button, 6 new cards should be loaded into the page.

- Form must have validation ( html attributes or Javascript)

- Below are technologies I used in order to create this page.

## Challenges

## Used Stacks
